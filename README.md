# Mazepy-3D
First person pseudo 3D (Doom like) maze using python and pygame.

### About
First person pseudo 3D maze. The goal is to navigate the maze to find the exit. Walk through the exit to complete the level.

I use raycasting technique like the one used in Wolfenstein Doom. Thanks to Coder Space youtube channel for the tutorial 
on this engine. Youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ECqUrT7IdqQ.
